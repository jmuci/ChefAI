## Before you start: two things to verify against the real schema

This prompt was written from the Android client's side of the contract, so its assumptions about
existing backend tables are inferences, not facts. Check both and adapt the SQL below:

1. **The owner column on `recipes`.** Written here as `recipes.user_id`. The Android entity calls the
   field `creatorId`, so the backend column may well be `creator_id`. Whichever it is, it is the
   column every ownership check in §3 and §6 keys on.
2. **How `image_url` is stored for a user-picked photo.** §3a derives `provenance` from
   `recipes.image_url = ''` — an **empty string**, not `NULL`. If the column is nullable and the
   client's blank string arrives as `NULL`, that check must become `coalesce(image_url, '') = ''`, or
   every user photo is misclassified as `SCRAPED` and refused whenever the kill switch is on.

## Context

The Android client stores every recipe hero image as a file on the device. Two sources feed it:

| Source | `recipes.image_url` | Can another device re-derive it? |
|---|---|---|
| Scraped from the recipe's source page at import | the third-party CDN URL | Yes, but only by driving an off-screen WebView — several CDNs (Akamai/Food Network, Cloudflare/Serious Eats) 403 every plain HTTP client, including the app's image loader |
| A photo the user picked from their gallery | **empty string** | **No. That device holds the only copy in existence.** |

A blank `image_url` is therefore a meaningful, load-bearing signal on the server too: **it means the
image is the user's own and cannot be recovered from anywhere else.**

The backend needs to accept those bytes, serve them back to the same user's other devices, and
reclaim them when they stop being referenced. Stack is **Kotlin + Ktor + PostgreSQL + Exposed DSL +
JWT** — same patterns as the existing recipe/bookmark sync endpoints.

**The client never sends image bytes through `/sync/push`.** That payload is JSON, batched fifty
recipes at a time. Images get their own endpoint, and the recipe row only ever carries a *pointer*.

---

## 1. Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE image_blobs (
    id                  UUID    PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id             UUID    NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content_hash        TEXT    NOT NULL,          -- lowercase sha256 hex of the stored bytes
    provenance          TEXT    NOT NULL,          -- USER | SCRAPED
    mime_type           TEXT    NOT NULL,          -- image/jpeg | image/png | image/webp
    byte_size           BIGINT  NOT NULL,
    storage_key         TEXT    NOT NULL,          -- opaque to callers; see §2
    created_at          BIGINT  NOT NULL,
    unreferenced_since  BIGINT  NULL,              -- set when no live recipe points here; see §6

    UNIQUE (user_id, content_hash)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_image_blobs_user_id            ON image_blobs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_image_blobs_unreferenced_since ON image_blobs(unreferenced_since)
    WHERE unreferenced_since IS NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE recipes ADD COLUMN image_blob_id TEXT NULL;   -- the content hash, not a FK
```

Three schema choices that are deliberate, not accidental:

- **`UNIQUE (user_id, content_hash)`, not `UNIQUE (content_hash)`.** Blobs are not deduplicated
  across users, so deletion, quota accounting, and any future takedown stay per-user and
  refcount-free. It also removes an existence oracle: without it, user B could probe whether user A
  has a given image by uploading a candidate and observing a dedup hit. Cross-user dedup is the
  obvious storage optimisation later — see §8 — but it is not worth its refcounting at this scale.
- **`provenance` is recorded but nothing reads it.** Serving (§3b) turns on recipe visibility alone.
  The column exists so that an owner-only serving rule can be re-imposed by config, and so a takedown
  can be executed by source, without a backfill that would be impossible to reconstruct after the
  fact. Derive it server-side; never accept it from the client.
- **`recipes.image_blob_id` stores the hash, not a surrogate FK.** The client treats it as an opaque
  change-token — "the image behind this recipe is different from the one I have" — and comparing
  hashes is exactly that test. A join to resolve a UUID would buy nothing.

---

## 2. Blob storage abstraction

Do **not** reach for an S3 SDK in this pass. Define the seam and implement the boring side of it:

```kotlin
interface BlobStore {
    suspend fun put(key: String, bytes: ByteArray, mimeType: String)
    suspend fun openRead(key: String): InputStream?
    suspend fun delete(key: String)
}

class LocalDiskBlobStore(private val root: Path) : BlobStore { /* … */ }
```

`storage_key` is generated as `"${userId}/${contentHash}"` and is opaque outside this interface.

Adding `aws-sdk-kotlin` / an R2 client is a dependency decision for whoever owns the deploy — flag it
and get sign-off rather than adding it here. The whole point of the seam is that swapping
`LocalDiskBlobStore` for an object-store implementation later touches one class, no endpoint, and no
client code.

---

## 3. Endpoints

### 3a. `PUT /recipes/{recipeId}/image` — upload

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
Content-Type: image/jpeg            (or image/png, image/webp)
X-Content-SHA256: <64 lowercase hex chars>
Body: raw image bytes, ≤ 5 MiB      (NOT multipart — exactly one file, no form fields)
```

**Validation, in this order.** Every rejection must be cheap and must happen before the bytes are
written anywhere:

| # | Check | Failure |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Valid JWT | `401` |
| 2 | Recipe exists **and** `recipes.user_id = caller` | `404` — same response for "doesn't exist" and "not yours", so the endpoint is not a recipe-existence oracle |
| 3 | `Content-Type` starts with `image/` and is one of jpeg/png/webp | `415` |
| 4 | Body ≤ 5 MiB, enforced **while streaming** | `413` — abort the read; never buffer an unbounded body to find out how big it was |
| 5 | `sha256(body)` equals `X-Content-SHA256` | `422` |
| 6 | Magic bytes match the declared type (`FF D8 FF` jpeg, `89 50 4E 47` png, `RIFF….WEBP` webp) | `415` — **do not trust `Content-Type`**; without this the endpoint is an authenticated arbitrary-file host |
| 7 | `provenance == SCRAPED` and `config.allowScrapedImageUpload == false` | `403 {"error":"SCRAPED_UPLOAD_DISABLED"}` |
| 8 | User's total `byte_size` + this upload ≤ quota | `403 {"error":"QUOTA_EXCEEDED"}` |

**Provenance is derived server-side, never taken from the client:**

```kotlin
val provenance = if (recipe.imageUrl.isBlank()) Provenance.USER else Provenance.SCRAPED
```

**Success path:**

1. If `(user_id, hash)` already exists **and** `recipes.image_blob_id == hash` → return `200` with the
   existing values and **do not touch `updated_at`**. This matters: bumping `updated_at` on a no-op
   re-upload makes the recipe appear in every subsequent pull delta, and a client retrying a
   misclassified error would churn forever.
2. Otherwise `BlobStore.put`, insert the `image_blobs` row (or reuse an existing one for the same
   `(user_id, hash)`), set `recipes.image_blob_id = hash`, set `recipes.updated_at = now()`.
3. If the recipe previously pointed at a different blob, run the dereference check from §6 on the old
   one.

**Response `200`:**

```json
{"imageBlobId": "9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08",
 "updatedAt": 1755100000000}
```

Do all of this in one transaction, with the `BlobStore.put` before the commit so a crash leaves an
orphaned object (reclaimable by the §6 sweep) rather than a row pointing at nothing.

### 3b. `GET /recipes/{recipeId}/image` — serve

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
If-None-Match: "<hash>"          (optional)
```

**Visibility follows the recipe, not the image's provenance:**

| | Caller is owner | Caller is another user |
|---|---|---|
| `PRIVATE` recipe | serve | **`404`** |
| `PUBLIC` recipe | serve | serve |

In other words: if the caller is allowed to see the recipe, they are allowed to see its image,
whether the image was scraped or photographed by the owner. Every "not visible" case returns `404`,
not `403`, for the same non-oracle reason as §3a check 2.

Gate the non-owner branch on `config.serveScrapedBlobsToNonOwners` (§5) when
`provenance = SCRAPED`. It ships `true`; the flag exists so the owner-only rule can be re-imposed
without a deploy of new code, not because it is expected to be flipped soon. See §8.

**Responses:**

```
200  Content-Type: <mime_type>
     Content-Length: <byte_size>
     ETag: "<content_hash>"
     Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable
     <bytes, streamed — do not load into memory>

304  when If-None-Match matches (blobs are immutable, so this is always safe)
404  no blob, recipe unknown, or not visible to the caller
```

### 3c. `DELETE /recipes/{recipeId}/image` — clear the pointer

Owner only. Sets `recipes.image_blob_id = NULL`, bumps `updated_at`, runs the §6 dereference check.
Returns `204`. Needed because the client's editor lets a user replace a photo with a source URL.

---

## 4. Sync protocol extension

Extend the existing `SyncRecipeDto` — **do not add a new sync endpoint.**

```diff
  data class SyncRecipeDto(
      val uuid: String,
      …
      val imageUrl: String,
      val imageUrlThumbnail: String,
+     val imageBlobId: String? = null,
      …
  )
```

**Push: ignore whatever the client sends in `imageBlobId`.** Persist the server's own value and echo
it back. The pointer is set exclusively by §3a and cleared exclusively by §3c.

This is not defensive pedantry — it is what keeps blobs out of last-writer-wins. A client cannot
point its recipe at a blob it never uploaded, and because blobs are immutable and content-addressed,
two devices can never disagree about a blob's *contents*. Which blob a recipe points at is settled by
the same `updated_at` LWW that already governs the row, with no new conflict class.

**Pull: include `imageBlobId`** in every recipe, including soft-deleted ones.

Nullable with a default, so an older client that doesn't send or understand the field keeps working.

---

## 5. Config

```kotlin
data class ImageBlobConfig(
    val allowScrapedImageUpload: Boolean = true,        // false → 403 SCRAPED_UPLOAD_DISABLED on §3a
    val serveScrapedBlobsToNonOwners: Boolean = true,   // false → §3b serves scraped blobs to the owner only
    val maxUploadBytes: Long = 5 * 1024 * 1024,
    val perUserQuotaBytes: Long = 500L * 1024 * 1024,
    val unreferencedRetentionDays: Int = 30,
)
```

The first two are kill switches, not tuning knobs. Hosting and publicly serving third-party images is
a deliberate, revisitable decision made while the app has no users (see §8); these flags are what
make retreating from it a config change instead of a release. `allowScrapedImageUpload = false` stops
accepting new scraped blobs — the Android client treats `403 SCRAPED_UPLOAD_DISABLED` as permanent
and stops retrying that recipe. `serveScrapedBlobsToNonOwners = false` narrows serving to the
uploading user, with existing blobs untouched and no data migration.

Add a per-user upload rate limit (suggested: 60/minute) on §3a.

---

## 6. Reclamation

A blob becomes **unreferenced** when no live recipe points at it:

```sql
SELECT NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM recipes
    WHERE image_blob_id = :hash AND user_id = :userId AND deleted_at IS NULL
);
```

Run that check whenever a recipe is soft-deleted through `/sync/push`, repointed by §3a, or cleared by
§3c. When it comes back true, set `unreferenced_since = now()`; when a blob is referenced again, clear
it back to `NULL`.

A scheduled job then hard-deletes blobs where
`unreferenced_since < now() - unreferencedRetentionDays`, removing the storage object first and the
row second (an orphaned row is recoverable; an orphaned object is only findable by a full scan).

The retention window exists because the client's delete is a **soft** delete with no undo
([ChefAI#129](https://github.com/jmuci/ChefAI/issues/129)), and
it deletes the local file immediately. The window is the only thing that would make a future "undo
delete" feature possible at all. Coordinate the number with
[#55](https://github.com/jmuci/ChefAI/issues/55) (account deletion & data retention) — account
deletion should cascade blobs immediately, not wait out the window.

The same job should sweep storage objects with no `image_blobs` row (crash-orphans from §3a).

---

## 7. Client-side wiring (Android, for alignment — not this task)

- `RecipeEntity` / `Recipe` / `SyncRecipeDto` gain `imageBlobId: String?` (Room v4).
- `RecipeImageUploadWorker` sweeps recipes with a local file and no matching blob pointer, uploads via
  §3a, and writes the returned hash back with a targeted `UPDATE` that does **not** bump `updated_at`.
  It only considers recipes already `SYNCED`, so the recipe always exists server-side before its
  image does.
- `RecipeImageBackfillWorker` gains a preferred tier: when `imageBlobId != null`, fetch §3b with the
  authenticated client and store it locally, only falling back to the scrape ladder otherwise.
- The image loader (Coil) never calls these endpoints — bytes are fetched by the worker and rendered
  from the local file, so no auth token is ever handed to the image-loading stack.

## 8. Later, not now — the 50-user checkpoint ([#144](https://github.com/jmuci/ChefAI/issues/144))

Each of these swaps in behind the endpoints above **without a client change** — worth preserving that
property when implementing:

- **DMCA §512(c) plumbing** — a registered agent, a takedown route keyed on `provenance` and the
  recipe's `image_url`, a repeat-infringer policy. Publicly serving scraped third-party images
  (§3b) is a real posture, consciously accepted here because the app has no users; that reasoning
  expires when it gets some. This is the item that makes the posture supported rather than merely
  accepted, and `serveScrapedBlobsToNonOwners = false` is the retreat if it isn't worth building.
- **Object storage / CDN** — replace `LocalDiskBlobStore`; §3b may then `302` to a short-lived signed
  URL instead of streaming. Egress from the app server is fine at 50 users and not at 5,000.
- **Cross-user dedup** — under §1's per-user keying, many users importing the same recipe store
  byte-identical copies. The first real storage lever after the quota, at the cost of refcounting on
  delete and a more careful takedown story.
- **Thumbnails** — `imageUrlThumbnail` is currently set to `imageUrl` by the client and is a lie.
  Server-side derivatives are the right fix; they need an image-processing dependency, so treat that
  as its own decision.

## 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] Migration creating `image_blobs` and adding `recipes.image_blob_id`
- [ ] `BlobStore` interface + `LocalDiskBlobStore`, no cloud SDK dependency added
- [ ] `PUT /recipes/{id}/image` with all eight validations from §3a, including magic-byte sniffing and
      the streaming size cap
- [ ] Re-uploading identical bytes for an unchanged recipe is a no-op that does **not** move
      `updated_at`
- [ ] `GET /recipes/{id}/image` honouring the §3b visibility table, with `ETag` / `304`
- [ ] `DELETE /recipes/{id}/image`
- [ ] `imageBlobId` returned on pull; client-supplied values on push ignored
- [ ] Reclamation job + dereference checks on soft-delete, repoint, and clear
- [ ] Quota and rate limit enforced
- [ ] Tests: hash mismatch → 422; a PNG body declared as `image/jpeg` → 415; oversized body → 413 with
      nothing written; a second user → 404 on another user's `PRIVATE` recipe image, 200 on a
      `PUBLIC` one regardless of provenance; `allowScrapedImageUpload = false` → 403 for a scraped
      image and 200 for a user photo; `serveScrapedBlobsToNonOwners = false` → that same second user
      now 404s on a `PUBLIC` recipe's scraped image but still 200s on its owner's photo
- [ ] Integration test: push recipe → upload image → pull → `imageBlobId` present → GET returns the
      exact bytes → soft-delete the recipe → blob marked unreferenced → sweep after the window
      deletes both row and object
